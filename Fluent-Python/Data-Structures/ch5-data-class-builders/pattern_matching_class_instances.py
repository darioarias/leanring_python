# Simple Class Patterns
# case [str(name), _, _, (float(lat), float(lon))]:
# The above matches a sequence where the first item is 
# an instance of str and the last item is a tuple containing 
# two float

#     match city:
#       case City(City.__match_args__[0] = 'Asia'):
#         print(city)


# what makes match work is the present of __match_args__
print(City.__match_args__)
