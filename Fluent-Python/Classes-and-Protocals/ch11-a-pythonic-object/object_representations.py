# Every object-oriented language has at least one standard way of getting a string representation from any object. 
# Python has two:
## repr()
### Return a string representing the object as the developer wants to see it. 
### It’s what you get when the Python console or a debugger shows an object.

## str()
### Return a string representing the object as the user wants to see it. 
### It’s what you get when you print() an object.
