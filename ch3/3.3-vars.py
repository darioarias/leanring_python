REASON FOR VARIABLES
1. Variables keep values accessible: 
  For example, the result of some time-consuming operation can be assigned 
  to a variable so that the operation does not need to be performed each time you need to use the result.
2. Variablesgivevaluescontext:
  Thenumber28couldmeanlots of different things, such as the number of students in a class, 
  or the number of times a user has accessed a website, and so on. 
  Naming the value 28 something like num_students makes the meaning of the value clear.
