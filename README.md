# My Learning Path Through Improving my Python Skills

## Overview
This is my journey improving my python skills. I am proficient in Javascript, but I noticed that JS does not have builtin support for DSA such as deque, binary search, min-heaps, etc. 

While interviewing with an engineer, I can 'finesse' and just mention the general form and usually this is enough. For example, while interviwing for company X, I needed to use a queue as part of my solution. JS does not have an optimized queue builtin, so I used an array and make sure I follow FIFO  using Shift and Push which is an overall O(N) (for pop) solution. I mention to the interviewer that if I had more time I would implement a O(1) (for pop) solution that this is okay. 

However, while taking a coding assesment where time complexity is enabled (i.e counts towards yout overall rating), I cannot just use an array as a Queue, worst yet, since most coding assesments are timed, the time I used to implement a queue is time waste since I could've used python all along and avoid all of this. Not to mention all of the other DSA support Python has.

## Resources
### [Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3](https://realpython.com/products/python-basics-book/)
  > Having used python in undergrad, and given the fact that I am proficient in Javascript, I knew most of the baisc Python's features. However, I wanted to take the time and start from zero and learn how things are actually done. Some new things I learn from this book include, listcomps and general best practicies. 
### [Fluent Python Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1492056359)
  > No words are enough to explain the depth cover in this book. The general layout consists of 5 mini books each focusing in one topic and diving into it. I strongly reccoment this book even if you have been using pythons for years. I primise this book has somehting for you. I see myself reading this book 5 years from now learning just as much.
