# My Learning Path Through Improving my Python Skills

## Overview
This is my journey of improving my python skills. I am proficient in Javascript, but I noticed that JS does not have built-in support for DSA, such as deque, binary search, min-heaps, etc.

While interviewing an engineer, I can 'finesse' and mention the general form, which is usually enough. For example, while interviewing for company X, I needed to use a queue as part of my solution. JS does not have an optimized queue built in, so I used an array and made sure I followed FIFO  using Shift and Push, which is an overall O(N) (for pop) solution. I told the interviewer that if I had more time, I would implement an O(1) (for pop) answer that this is okay.  

However, while taking a coding assessment where time complexity is enabled (i.e., counts towards your overall rating), I cannot just use an array as a Queue; worst yet, since most coding assessments are timed, the time I used to implement a queue is time waste since I could've used python all along and avoid all of this. Not to mention all of the other DSA support Python has.

## Resources
### [Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3](https://realpython.com/products/python-basics-book/)
  > Having used Python as an undergrad, given that I am proficient in Javascript, I knew most of the basic features found in Python. However, I wanted to take the time to start from zero and learn how things are done. This book taught me new things, including list comps and general best practices.
  
### [Fluent Python Clear, Concise, and Effective Programming, 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1492056359)
  > No word or paragraph can explain this book's depth cover. The general layout consists of 5 mini-books, each focusing on one topic and diving into it. I strongly recommend this book, even if you have used pythons for years. I promise this book has something for you. I see myself reading this book five years from now and learning just as much. 

### [Introduction to Algorithms, fourth edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X)
  > Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover masses of material but lack rigor. Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. It covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers, with self-contained chapters and algorithms in pseudocode.

## What's next?
I am finishing Fluent Python. Leetcode with the new skills to get even more comfortable using Python. Interviews, interviews!
