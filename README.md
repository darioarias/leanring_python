# leanring_python
this is my journey throw improving my python skills. I am proficient in Javascript, but I noticed that in interview, JS does not have built in data structures and I have to implement any I want to use on the spot. Python on the other hand does have built in DSA so I want to learn python in depth so I can interview in it.
