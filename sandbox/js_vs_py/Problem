Given the root of a tree, return a list with every node by level, from left to right. 
Example: 
             10  <-- (root)
        5         15
    2      7   12     17  

Your code should return: [10, 5, 15, 2, 7, 12, 17]

Note: we do not care what data structure or algorithm you use, we only care about the output
Moreover, the solution has to be strictly O(N) or better in time and space complexity
